**Intro to TensorFlow**

**24 October 2016**

**Intro:**

* Get access to open image dataset by Google, run them on inception and try interesting things with them.

* TensorFlow idea: flow of tensors from level to level.

* TensorFlow programs are written in python.

* Inception is a particular form of the data flow graph.

**TensorFlow examples:**

* mult.py: shows you idea of TensorFlow varialbe, TensorFlow function, and TensorFlow session.

* regression.py: program to demonstrate linear regression.

* kmeans.py: separate dataset into a number of clusters (in demo output looked like a Vornoi diagram). Number of clusters is passed to program as input (make best guess as to what number of clusters is).

**Inceptionism:**

* Hot area of research.

* This is where TensorFlow is used to translate the network architecture into code.
