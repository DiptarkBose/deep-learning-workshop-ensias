**Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning**

**27 October 2016**

**Intro:**

* CUDA: framework to program NVIDIA GPUs.

* Convolutional neural nets: very effective for image processing.

* Readily available network architectures. Described in research papers.

* Can use those to learn and then tweak them or come up with your own networks architectures.

* Deep Learning is data agnostic. You can feed it image data, video data, audio data, etc..

**Gate:**

* Tool for doing NLP tasks.

* Text mining is the discovery of new, previously unknown information from different textual resources.

    * Key element: link extracted information to form new facts/hypotheses.

* Text mining != data mining.  Data mining is about finding patterns in structured DBs.

* Text mining != web search. In web search the user is usually looking for something already known.

* Named Entity Recognition is a cornerstone of IE.

    * NE pipeline.

* Gate: most widely used tool for NLP.

    * Developed in the University of Sheffield.

* Annie: tool for information extraction.
