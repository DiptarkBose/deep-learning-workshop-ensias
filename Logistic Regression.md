**Logistic Regression**

25 October 2016

**A bit of Review:**

* Image processing by using inception architecture of neural networks.

* Make use of power of GPU (GPU’s are moving from being graphics drivers to general purpose processors).

* TensorFlow is a python library for writing/analysing neural network. Makes it easy to analyse neural networks and abstracts the details of training code..

* Neural Network: layers (convolutional layer, etc..).

* Convolution (sliding window): slide small image of 0’s and 1’s and XOR it with parts of the image. We can analyze the red, the green, and the blue separately. This is basically searching for patterns and passing them to the next layer.

* How to find the patterns ? Generate random ones and see how often they occur in the image. If a pattern occurs several times then maybe that pattern is a feature of the image.

* Applications of image segmentation: cancer detection, driverless cars.

* Industries affected by Deep Learning: healthcare.

* Nvidia courses on deep learning.

**Logistic Regression:**

* Click-Through Rate prediction (applications in e-commerce).

* One-Not Encoding: convert categorical features into numerical features (cat into number for example).

* Use sparse vectors to store the encoding (many entries will be 0’s after doing one-hot encoding).
